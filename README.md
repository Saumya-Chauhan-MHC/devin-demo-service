# Devin Demo Service

### A scaffold microservice for demonstrating the **Devin Issues CLI**

This repository is a lightweight **demo project** used to showcase how the
**[Devin Issues CLI](https://github.com/your-username/devin-cli)** connects with GitHub Issues and Devin to:

* Automatically **scope issues** with detailed plans and confidence levels
* Generate **branches, commits, and PRs** via Devin’s GitHub App integration
* Provide end-to-end visibility from “bug filed” → “PR opened”

---

## Project Overview

The service simulates a basic **FastAPI-like** backend with three key components:

| File                    | Description                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/main.py`           | Minimal healthcheck route (`/health`) that occasionally fails (used for testing bug fixes). |
| `app/metrics.py`        | Placeholder Prometheus metrics endpoint stub.                                               |
| `app/logging_config.py` | Simple JSON logger setup used to demonstrate enhancements like `request_id` propagation.    |

Together, these files provide realistic but simple "issues" for Devin to analyze, just enough for meaningful scoping and PR creation.

## How It’s Used in the CLI Demo

This repo is the `DEFAULT_REPO` target for the **Devin Issues CLI**.
You’ll see it referenced in our demo's `.env` as:

```bash
DEFAULT_REPO=Saumya-Chauhan-MHC/devin-demo-service
```

When you run:

```bash
devin-cli issues list --repo Saumya-Chauhan-MHC/devin-demo-service
```

You’ll see a few pre-populated open issues, like:

```
#1  Bug: /health intermittently returns 500 (staging)
#2  Feature: Add Prometheus /metrics endpoint
#3  Enhancement: Structured JSON logs + request_id propagation
```

These mimic a real-world engineering backlog — perfect for demonstrating Devin’s scoping and PR automation.

## End-to-End Demo Reference

This repository pairs directly with the **[Devin Issues CLI Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/83ca12c2be174387a53ad76f60e5d7b3?sid=b20a888e-99e7-4311-8ad1-2d2efad2f20a)**,
which shows the full workflow from **issue listing → scoping → confidence → PR creation**.
